# zomato-data-analysis
This is the step by step process to analyse the data using python
Import all necessary python libraries - here we use pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn
Create the Data Frame using the pd.read_csv("file path")
clean the data by using some techniques to convert from one datatype to another another datatype
check for NULL values
To address our analysis, we need to respond to the subsequent inquiries:
Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?.
After that do analysis for evry column and row
First explore the listed_in (type) column.
we can determine the restaurantâ€™s name that received the maximum votes based on a given dataframe.
explore the online_order column.
explore the rate column.
explore the approx_cost(for two people) column.
we will examine whether online orders receive higher ratings than offline orders.
CONCLUSION: Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive online orders. This suggests that clients prefer to place orders in person at restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.
